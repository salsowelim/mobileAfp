# Audio fingerprinting in mobile with react-native

This sample code demonstrates how to include a [c++ audio fingerprinting function](https://github.com/salsowelim/dejavu_cpp_port), in a react native project. Additionally a suggested method to record raw audio is provided for both iOS and Android.

**Note**: The project will not run out of the box. You have to at least include OpenCV and make sure you have set NDK for Android.
